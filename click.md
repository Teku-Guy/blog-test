Heres an example on what you could do with this Site. See Jekyll is a great way for post because it can use either html or Markdown text and it will automatically generates all the `CSS` and `HTML`. You can even add a contact form like this one below.

<form method="POST" action="//formspree.io/gusmuratalla@gmail.com">
    <input type="text" name="name">
    <input type="email" name="_replyto">
    <input type="submit" value="Send">
</form>

Just insert this code snippet:
{% highlight html %}
<form method="POST" action="//formspree.io/gusmuratalla@gmail.com">
    <input type="text" name="name">
    <input type="email" name="_replyto">
    <input type="submit" value="Send">
</form>
{% endhighlight %}

It's not pretty becuase it has basic styling but with more effort it could look amazing.
